# Google Cloud Platform PowerShell

This repository contains PowerShell cmdlets for interacting with the Google Cloud Platform.

:construction: This is a work in progress. :construction: You will need to build from source to install and look at the code for documentation. Hopefully by the time this repository is public you will be able to:

- [ ] Install these cmdlets from the Cloud SDK (`gcloud components update beta powershell`)
- [ ] Read documentation published via a GitHub Pages site.
- [ ] Read documentation for how to build, test, and submit patches for this project.

# Support

To get help on using these cmdlets, please log an issue with this project. While we will eventually be able to offer support on StackOVerflow or a Google+ community, for how your best bet is to contact the dev team directly.

Patches are encouraged, and may be submitted by forking this project and submitting a Pull Request.
