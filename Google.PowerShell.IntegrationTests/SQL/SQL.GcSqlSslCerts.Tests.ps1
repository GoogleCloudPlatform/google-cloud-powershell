    # A note for this series of tests: 
    # Due to the fact the list functionality does not tell SSL certificate sha1fingerprints, all tests for 
    # if singular get is working have to use a premade SSL certificate. 
    # This can change once the Add-GcSqlSslCert cmdlet is done,
    # as we can then get a test-specific SSLCertificate and its sha1fingerprint.
